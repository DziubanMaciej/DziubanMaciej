## About
I'm a software developer passionate about computer graphics, GPU and high performance computing. Currently employed at AMD. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) profile.


## Some of my personal projects
- [cmag](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/cmag) - Interactive analyzer and browser for CMake build systems. This tools aims to provide a graphical representation of complex build systems with different dependencies, properties, etc.
- [emos](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/emos) - A MOS 6502 processor emulator.
- [PicoGpu](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/PicoGpu) - Implementation of a simplified GPU using SystemC. My first attempt to use the library. I implemented a simple rendering pipeline with programmable blocks, memory subsystem, depth buffering and an assembler for my own assembly shading language.
- [Oakum](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/Oakum) - Memory leak detection library for C++ projects. Especially useful for ensuring memory safety in short code sequences, like unit tests.

## My stupid April Fools projects
- 2023 [OtwartyJO](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/OtwartyJO) - Translation of OpenCL library API to Polish language. Translated header is generated by parsing original `cl.h` header and using a lookup table to translate or keywords from English to Polish.
- 2024 [glBamboozle](https://github.com/DziubanMaciej/glBamboozle) - An OpenGL loader, which intercepts OpenGL calls of real applications (e.g. games) and alters them to create funky visual effects. This project was not completed and there are not a lot of effects implemented.

## My GitHub organisations that I use as "directories" for repositories
-  [LegacyMD](https://github.com/LegacyMD) - my old and forgotten repositories
-  [MessMD](https://github.com/MessMD) - my playground repositories for trying things out.
-  [ForksMD](https://github.com/ForksMD) - my forked repositories used for opensource contributions.
-  [PaiSetup](https://github.com/PaiSetup) - my personal scripts, tools and configurations I use.
